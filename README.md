# CSI5388/ELG7186 Example notebooks

This repository contains examples of how to use ML methods in practice.

1. **Over/Under sampling in practice**: This notebook is intended to demonstrate how to use oversampling/undersampling strategies in practice with The Decision Tree Classifier used as example algorithm.

2. **Online learning in practice**: In this notebook, two online learning libraries implemented in python, [riverml](https://riverml.xyz/dev/) and [scikit-multiflow](https://scikit-multiflow.github.io), have been used for demonstration.

3. **Intrusion Detection in practice**: In this notebook, several experiments are carried out on the [CSE-CIC-IDS2018](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html) data set for intrusion detection.
