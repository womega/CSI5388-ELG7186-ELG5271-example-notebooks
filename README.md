# CSI5388/ELG7186/ELG5271 Example notebooks

This repository contains examples of how to use ML methods in practice.

1. **Over/Under sampling in practice**: This notebook is intended to demonstrate how to use oversampling/undersampling strategies in practice with The Decision Tree Classifier used as example algorithm.

2. **Online learning in practice**: In this notebook, three online learning libraries implemented in python, [riverml](https://riverml.xyz/dev/), [streamndr](https://github.com/jgaud/streamndr), and [scikit-multiflow](https://scikit-multiflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) have been used for demonstration.

3. **Intrusion Detection in practice**: In this notebook, several experiments are carried out on the [CSE-CIC-IDS2018](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html) data set for intrusion detection.

3. **Anomaly Detection in practice**: This notebook is intended to demonstrate how to use anomaly detectors implemented in [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html).
